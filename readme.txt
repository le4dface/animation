COMP308: ASSIGNMENT TWO

*************************
OVERVIEW AND INSTRUCTIONS
*************************

For this assignment, I have completed the core, challenge and extension.

My program has two distinct modes:

1) The Pose Manipulator Mode

	Loading the Pose Manipulator:
	- The Pose Manipulator Mode is loaded when only a .asf files is provided.
	- Provide 'Files/priman.asf' as the single argument when you run the program.
	
	Controls for the Pose Manipulator:
	- Pressing 'r' will make the model rotate around it's Y-AXIS, 5 degrees.
	- Pressing 'p' will cycle through three different poses:
		a) Seated
		b) Walking
		c) Michael Jackson, ow!	
		
	- Clicking on a Joint(sphere) will select that joint(Sphere) using the
	Colour picking method described in the lecture notes. 
	- Note that each Joint has three arrows sticking out of it - by pressing
		'b' you will rotate the selected joint around it's x-axis, 
		'n' you will rotate the selected joint around it's y-axis
		'm' you will rotate the selected joint around it's z-axis
	
	- Using these controls you can create any pose you like.
	
2) The Motion Capture Video Player

	Loading the Motion Capture Video Player:
	- The motion capture video player is loaded when a .asf and .amc are both loaded.
	- Provide 'File/priman.asf File/priman.amc' as your arguments when you run the program.
	
	Control for the Motion Capture Video Player:
	- To access the video player options, i.e. play, pause, stop, fast-forward,rewind
	simply 'Right-Click' on the screen with your mouse to open the pop-up
	menu.
	- 'a' and 'd' allow you to rotate the camera clockwise and anti-clockwise around the model.
	- Scrolling the mouse wheel will zoom in / zoom out the camera
	- Adjust the light direction ('z','x','c') -> (x,y,z)

Have fun!
